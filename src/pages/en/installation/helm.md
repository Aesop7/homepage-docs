There is an [unofficial helm chart](https://github.com/jameswynn/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/homepage) that creates all the necessary manifests, including the service account and RBAC entities necessary for service discovery.

```sh
helm repo add jameswynn https://jameswynn.github.io/helm-charts
helm install homepage jameswynn/homepage -f values.yaml
```

The helm chart allows for all the configurations to be inlined directly in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml

        - Github:
